        <p>IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY, THEN YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE AUTHORIZED TO BIND SUCH ENTITY TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT APPLIES TO ALL USERS OF THE WEBSITES OR THE SERVICE, INCLUDING USERS WHO ARE ALSO CONTRIBUTORS OF CONTENT, INFORMATION, AND OTHER MATERIALS OR SERVICES ON THE WEBSITES.</p><br>
        <div class="use">
            <ol>
                <li><b>Acceptance of Terms:</b> The Service is offered subject to acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time on the Websites by Technovation. In addition, some services offered through the Service may be subject to additional terms and conditions promulgated by Technovation from time to time; your use of such services is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which are incorporated into these Terms of Use by this reference.</li><br>
                <li><b>Modification of Terms of Use:</b> Technovation reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any of the Terms of Use, or change, suspend, or discontinue the Service (including without limitation, the availability of any feature, database, or content) at any time by posting a notice on the Websites or by sending you an email. Technovation may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Service without notice or liability. It is your responsibility to check the Terms of Use periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to the Terms of Use constitutes acceptance of those changes.</li><br>
                <li><b>Privacy:</b> Technovation’s current Websites privacy statement is located at <a href="C:\Users\Moscow\Documents\techpreneur\privacy.html" style="color: rgb(207, 6, 143);"> C:\Users\Moscow\Documents\techpreneur\privacy.html</a> and is incorporated into these Terms of Use.</li><br>
                <li><b>Rules and Conduct:</b> As a condition of use, you promise not to use the Service for any purpose that is prohibited by the Terms of Use. The Service (including, without limitation, any Content, or User Submissions (both as defined below)) is provided only for your own personal, non-commercial use. You are responsible for all of your activity in connection with the Service. For purposes of the Terms of Use, the term “Content” includes, without limitation, any advertisements, advice, suggestions, videos, audio clips, written forum comments, information, data, text, photographs, software, scripts, graphics, and interactive features generated, provided, or otherwise made accessible by Technovation or its partners on or through the Service.</li><br>
                <li><b>Registration:</b> The Websites are not available to any users who were previously suspended from using the Websites or removed from the Websites by Technovation, or any persons under the age of thirteen (13) whose registration has not been approved by a legal parent or guardian. By accepting these Terms of Use or by registering for an account on any of the Websites, You represent that (1) You have not previously been suspended from using the Websites or removed from the Websites by Technovation, (2) that You are either at least thirteen (13) years of age or Your parent or guardian has consented to Your use of the Websites, and (3) that Your registration and use of the Websites is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.</li><br>
                <li><b>Child Users:</b> If You are a User of the Websites and are under the age of 13 (“Child User”), You may not register an account for the Websites without consent and approval from your legal parent or guardian. A Child User that begins the registration process for himself or herself without a Parent User may have the registration process restricted until a Parent User approves or assumes responsibility for the Child User account. Additionally, a Child User may use the Websites if registered through certain educational organizations or, in certain cases (as defined below), by Coaches that have entered into a relationship directly with Technovation and through which education organization or Coach the legal parent and/or guardian of such Child User has consented to use of the Websites. Further, in certain instances, a Child User may use our Websites via one of the third party applications that integrate into or with the Websites. A Child User that has registered through such external educational organizations, third party applications, or Coaches will only be permitted to use the Websites for so long as Technovation reasonably believes that such access has been consented to by the Child User’s parent or guardian.</li><br>
                <li><b>Parent Users:</b> If You are at least 18 years of age and you are the legal parent or guardian of a child that seeks to register as a Child User of the Websites, You may register a parent account on the Websites (“Parent User”). As a Parent User, you may create, register, manage and approve Child User accounts only for your own child(ren) or child(ren) for whom you are a legal guardian. IF YOU REGISTER, APPROVE THE REGISTRATION OF, OR OTHERWISE ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CHILD USER, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE SUCH CHILD USER’S LEGAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN AND YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS ON BEHALF OF SUCH CHILD USER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION BEING LIABLE FOR ALL USE OF THE WEBSITES BY THE CHILD USER. You acknowledge that Technovation may choose, but is not obligated, to make any inquiries, either directly or through third parties, that Technovation deems necessary to validate Your registration information, including without limitation engaging third parties to provide verification services. Technovation reserves all rights to take legal actions against anyone who misrepresents personal information or is otherwise untruthful about their identity. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TECHNOVATION CANNOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY ANY USER AND IS NOT OBLIGATED TO VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF ANY USER, INCLUDING ANY USER’S CLAIM TO BE A PARENT USER, OR TO VERIFY THAT A PARENT IDENTIFIED BY A CHILD USER DURING REGISTRATION IS SUCH CHILD USER’S ACTUAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN. A Parent User account, along with all associated Child User accounts, may be terminated by Technovation at any time and without warning for any failure to abide by these Terms.</li><br>
                <li><b>Third Party Sites:</b> The Service may permit you to link to other websites or resources on the Internet, and other websites or resources may contain links to the Websites. When you access third party websites, you do so at your own risk. These other websites are not under Technovation’s control, and you acknowledge that Technovation is not responsible or liable for the content, functions, accuracy, legality, appropriateness or any other aspect of such websites or resources. The inclusion of any such link does not imply endorsement by Technovation or any association with its operators. You further acknowledge and agree that Technovation shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such Content, goods or services available on or through any such website or resource.</li><br>

Technovation, its affiliates or staff are in no way liable for such emergency calls or communications. By agreeing to these Terms of Use you understand that additional arrangements must be made to access Emergency Services. To access Emergency Services, you acknowledge and accept your responsibility to purchase, separately from the Service, traditional wireless or wireline telephone service and other means of communication intended for access to Emergency Services. You recognize and agree that Technovation is not required to offer Emergency Services or access thereto pursuant to any applicable local and or national rules, regulation or law. You further acknowledge that Technovation is not a replacement for your primary telephone service or any other means of communication.</li><br>
                <li><b>Technovation and Site Content: </b>You may, to the extent the Websites expressly authorize you to do so, download or copy the Content, and other items displayed on the Websites for download, for personal use only, provided that you maintain all copyright and other notices contained in such Content.
